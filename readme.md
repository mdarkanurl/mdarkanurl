<h1> Hi Mohammad Arkan. </h1> 
And I'm a backend developer who focused on building real-world, scalable, complex, and secure systems.

Iâ€™ve built the backend for down ðŸ‘‡
social media platforms,
e-commerce systems,
personal blogs,
real-time apps,
booking app,
abvance auth app,
and a LeetCode-style problem solver â€” featuring Dockerized code execution and message-based architecture.

I work with Node.js, Express, Prisma, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Docker. I often implement testing strategies like unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in important projects. I use AI daily to speed up development and occasionally explore ways to integrate it into my work.
Iâ€™m always learning â€” improving in architecture, deployment, testing, and real-time systems.
