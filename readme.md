# Mohammad Arkan

I’m a backend developer skilled in TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and microservices architecture. I build reliable, high-performance APIs, design low-latency backend systems, and implement secure authentication and authorization services. I work with AI technologies to integrate intelligent features into applications. Experienced in third-party integrations, testing with Jest and Supertest, and deploying with Docker and cloud platforms, I focus on creating scalable, efficient, and maintainable backend solutions that power modern, AI-driven applications.

💡 **Current Focus:** Preparing for remote backend opportunities and building impactful open-source projects.
